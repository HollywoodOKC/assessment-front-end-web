  <p id="westlawton">Southwest Oklahoma was the home for many Native American tribes due to the natural resources
    provided by the nearby 60,000-acre outcropping of ancient granite now called the Wichita Mountains, with water,
    wildlife, vegetation, in abundance. This area is now the
    Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Refuge. Lawton's history is inextricably tied to
    Fort Sill, established in 1869 during the hostilities in the Indian Territory.
    This land was granted to the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apache tribes by the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867, which
    continued warring against the military until Comanche Chief Quanah Parker and his Quohada Comanches abandoned the
    struggle and arrived at Fort Sill in June 1875.
    In 1891 the United States Congress appointed a commission under David H. Jerome to meet with the tribal leaders and
    come to an agreement allowing white settlement. Under pressure from the commission, Quanah Parker and the other
    Native American tribal leaders initially agreed to give the government control of the lands for $1.25 per acre. Each
    tribal member would receive a 160-acre allotment, with 400,000 acres reserved for grazing land for white cattle ranchers.
    After years of controversy and legal maneuvering on both sides, President William McKinley issued a proclamation
    which gave the government control over 2,000,000 acres for less than $1 per acre.</p>
